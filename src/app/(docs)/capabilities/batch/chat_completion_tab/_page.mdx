A batch file for chat completions, with `v1/chat/completions` as the Endpoint and `ministral-3b-latest` as the Model, would look like the following:

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="file" label="Batch File" default>

```bash

As a JSONL file, each line represents a request to the API Endpoint and Model.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="chat-completions-explained">Explanation</SectionTab>

The body request will follow the same format as the endpoint you want to run your batching, except the model id that will be provided only during the job creation to start the batch run. Below we provide an example of row with chat completions:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="file" label="Sample Example" default>

```py

    "custom_id": "2", # An ID as metadata that will be returned in the output file to identify the request
