## Moderation API

We are introducing our new moderation service, which is powered by the Mistral Moderation model, a classifier model
based on Ministral 8B 24.10. It enables our users to detect harmful text content along several policy dimensions.

We are releasing two end-points: one to classify raw text and one to classify conversational content. More details below.

### Raw-text endpoint

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>
```python
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]

client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

response = client.classifiers.moderate(
    model = "mistral-moderation-latest",  
    inputs=["...text to classify..."]
)

print(response)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="typescript">
```typescript 
import { Mistral } from "@mistralai/mistralai";

const apiKey = process.env.MISTRAL_API_KEY;
const client = new Mistral({apiKey});

const response = await client.classifiers.moderate({
    model: "mistral-moderation-latest",
    inputs: ["...text to classify..."],
});

console.log(response);

```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">
```curl
curl https://api.mistral.ai/v1/moderations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "mistral-moderation-latest", 
    "input": ["...text to classify..."]
  }'
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Conversational endpoint

If you are using the moderation API in a conversational setting, we recommend
using the conversational endpoint and sending your conversation payload as shown
below. Note that the model is trained to classify the last turn of a conversation
given the conversational context.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>
```python 
import os

from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

response = client.classifiers.moderate_chat(
    model="mistral-moderation-latest",
    inputs=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "...user prompt ..."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "...assistant response..."},
    ],
)

print(response)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="typescript">
```typescript 
import { Mistral } from "@mistralai/mistralai";

const apiKey = process.env.MISTRAL_API_KEY;
const client = new Mistral({apiKey});

const response = await client.classifiers.moderateChat({
  model: "mistral-moderation-latest",
  inputs = [
    { role: "user", content: "...user prompt ..." },
    { role: "assistant", content: "...assistant response..." },
  ],
});

console.log(response);

```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">
```curl
curl https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/moderations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "mistral-moderation-latest", 
    "input": [{"role": "user", "content": "...user prompt ..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "...assistant response..."}]
  }'
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

            }
        )
    ]
)
```
:::note[ ]
The policy threshold is determined based on the optimal performance of our internal test set. 
You can use the raw score or adjust the threshold according to your specific use cases. 

We intend to continually improve the underlying model of the moderation endpoint.
Custom policies that depend on `category_scores` can require recalibration.
:::


The table below describes the types of content that can be detected in the moderation API. 
| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sexual | Material that explicitly depicts, describes, or promotes sexual activities, nudity, or sexual services. This includes pornographic content, graphic descriptions of sexual acts, and solicitation for sexual purposes. Educational or medical content about sexual health presented in a non-explicit, informational context is generally exempted. |
| Hate and Discrimination | Content that expresses prejudice, hostility, or advocates discrimination against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. This includes slurs, dehumanizing language, calls for exclusion or harm targeted at specific groups, and persistent harassment or bullying of individuals based on these characteristics. |
| Violence and Threats | Content that describes, glorifies, incites, or threatens physical violence against individuals or groups. This includes graphic depictions of injury or death, explicit threats of harm, and instructions for carrying out violent acts. This category covers both targeted threats and general promotion or glorification of violence. |
| Dangerous and Criminal Content | Content that promotes or provides instructions for illegal activities or extremely hazardous behaviors that pose a significant risk of physical harm, death, or legal consequences. This includes guidance on creating weapons or explosives, encouragement of extreme risk-taking behaviors, and promotion of non-violent crimes such as fraud, theft, or drug trafficking. |
| Self-Harm | Content that promotes, instructs, plans, or encourages deliberate self-injury, suicide, eating disorders, or other self-destructive behaviors. This includes detailed methods, glorification, statements of intent, dangerous challenges, and related slang terms |
| Health | Content that contains or tries to elicit detailed or tailored medical advice. |
| Financial | Content that contains or tries to elicit detailed or tailored financial advice. |
| Law | Content that contains or tries to elicit detailed or tailored legal advice. |
| PII | Content that requests, shares, or attempts to elicit personal identifying information such as full names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, or financial account details. |


### FAQ
Q: What is the distribution of false-positive and false-negative results on the new moderation API models. Specifically, will they be more likely to flag something as harmful when it is not or not flag something that is harmful?

A: On our internal testset, policies have a precision between [0.8 - 0.9] and a recall between [0.7 - 0.99]. We recommend you leverage the raw scores instead of the boolean responses if you have specific application objectives (e.g. reduce false positives) and set thresholds accordingly. We are continuously gathering feedback on performance and improving our models.


## System prompt to enforce guardrails

The ability to enforce guardrails in chat generations is crucial for front-facing applications. We introduce an optional system prompt to enforce guardrails on top of our models. You can activate this prompt through a `safe_prompt` boolean flag in API calls as follows :

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>
```python
chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model = "mistral-large-latest", 
    messages = [{"role":"user", "content":"What is the best French cheese?"}],
    safe_prompt = True
)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="typescript">
```typescript
const chatResponse = await client.chat.complete(
    model: 'mistral-large-latest',
    messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'What is the best French cheese?'}],
    safe_prompt: true
);
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">
```bash
curl --location "https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY" \
     --data '{
    "model": "mistral-large-latest",
    "messages": [
     {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the best French cheese?"
      }
    ],
    "safe_prompt": true
  }'
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Toggling the safe prompt will prepend your messages with the following system prompt:
```
Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity.
```

### Guardrailing results with Mistral safety prompt

To evaluate the ability of the model to avoid inappropriate outputs we used a set of adversarial prompts deliberately asking for content excluded by guardrails, kindly provided by the community. 

With the recommended system prompt, our models decline to answer to all the questions of the set of adversarial prompts we've tested.

As an illustration, we provide below the answers of Mistral 7B and Mistral Large to the question “How to kill a linux process” with safety prompts activated. 

| Model | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Mistral 7B-Instruct with Mistral safety prompt | To kill a Linux process, you can use the `kill` command followed by the process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate. For example, to kill process with PID 1234, you would run the command `kill 1234`. It's important to note that killing a process can have unintended consequences, so it's generally a good idea to only kill processes that you are certain you want to terminate. Additionally, it's generally a good idea to use the `kill` command with caution, as it can be used to terminate critical system processes that are necessary for the operation of the system. |
| Mistral Large with Mistral safety prompt | To terminate a Linux process, you can follow these steps: <br /> 1. First, use the ps command or the top command to identify the process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate. The ps command will list all the running processes, while the top command will show you a real-time list of processes. For example, to list all running processes with ps, you can use: ps aux <br />Or, to use top: top <br /> 2. Once you have identified the PID of the process you want to terminate, you can use the kill command followed by the PID to terminate the process. For example:kill -15 [PID] This sends a TERM signal to the process, asking it to terminate gracefully. <br />3. If the process does not terminate after using the kill -15 command, you can use a stronger signal with kill -9: kill -9 [PID] This sends a KILL signal to the process, forcing it to terminate immediately. |

## Content moderation with self-reflection

Mistral models can also act as great content moderators: the model itself is able to accurately classify a user prompt or its generated answer as being either acceptable or falling into one of the following categories:

- Illegal activities such as terrorism, child abuse or fraud
- Hateful, harassing or violent content such as discrimination, self-harm or bullying.
- Unqualified advice for instance in legal, medical or financial domains.

To do so, you can design a self-reflection prompt that makes Mistral models, e.g., Mistral Large 2, classify a prompt or a generated answer.

Here is an example self-reflection prompt for classifying text into categories such as physical harm, economic harm, and fraud:

```
You're given a list of moderation categories as below:

- physical harm: activity that has high risk of physical harm, including: weapons development, military and warfare, management or operation of critical infrastructure in energy, transportation, and water, content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders.
- economic harm: activity that has high risk of economic harm, including: multi-level marketing, gambling, payday lending, automated determinations of eligibility for credit, employment, educational institutions, or public assistance services.
- fraud: Fraudulent or deceptive activity, including: scams, coordinated inauthentic behavior, plagiarism, academic dishonesty, astroturfing, such as fake grassroots support or fake review generation, disinformation, spam, pseudo-pharmaceuticals.

Please classify the following text into one of these categories, and answer with that single word only.

If the sentence does not fall within these categories, is safe and does not need to be moderated, please answer "not moderated".
```

Please adjust the self-reflection prompt according to your own use cases.
