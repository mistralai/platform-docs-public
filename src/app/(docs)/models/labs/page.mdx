# Labs

Labs are **experimental and fast moving models** available for a limited amount of time.  
We provide access to these models for developers and the community to try them out and provide feedback, allowing us to iterate faster and improve them!

:::note
If you are interested in our Labs models for enterprise use cases, please [reach out to us](https://mistral.ai/contact)

Labs are indentifed by the `Labs` tag in the model card and the `labs-` prefix in the model name identifier.  
For example: `labs-devstral-small-2512`

As lab models, we iterate and may update them frequently - they are subject to change and **may be deprecated or removed with 2 weeks' notice.**

:::note
We do not recommend using these models in production environments. However, you are welcome to explore them and share your experience.
