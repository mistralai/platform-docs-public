Audio input capabilities enable models to chat and understand audio directly, this can be used for both chat use cases via audio or for optimal transcription purposes.

### Models with Audio Capabilities
Audio capable models:
- Voxtral Small (`voxtral-small-latest`) with audio input for [chat](#chat-with-audio) use cases.
- Voxtral Mini (`voxtral-mini-latest`) with audio input for [chat](#chat-with-audio) use cases and efficient [transcription](#transcription) only service.

        **Assistant**

        Sure, here is the transcription of what you said:  
        "Today on July 15th, 2025, Mistral AI is announcing the new Voxtral models."  
        And here is the Python code to generate the first n digits of the Fibonacci sequence:  
        ```python
            def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 0:
            return []
        elif n == 1:
            return [0]
        elif n == 2:
            return [0, 1]

        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            next_value = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
            fib_sequence.append(next_value)

        return fib_sequence

        # Example usage:
        n = 10  # Change this value to get the first n digits of the Fibonacci sequence
        print(fibonacci(n))
        ```
        This code defines a function `fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list containing the first `n` digits of the Fibonacci sequence. You can change the value of `n` to get the desired number of Fibonacci digits.

        Which speaker do you prefer between the two? Why? How are they different from each other?

        **Assistant**

        The speaker who delivers the farewell address is more engaging and inspiring.  
        They express gratitude and optimism, emphasizing the importance of self-government and citizenship.  
        They also share personal experiences and observations, making the speech more relatable and heartfelt.  
        In contrast, the second speaker provides factual information about the weather in Barcelona, which is less engaging and lacks the emotional depth of the first speaker's address.
