Here is an example of how to use our BBox Annotation functionalities.

<SectionTab as="h3" variant="secondary" sectionId="bbox-define-the-data-model">Define the Data Model</SectionTab>

First, define the response formats for `BBox Annotation`, using either Pydantic or Zod schemas for our SDKs, or a JSON schema for a curl API call.

Pydantic/Zod/JSON schemas accept nested objects, arrays, enums, etc...

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

# BBOX Annotation response formats
class Image(BaseModel):
  image_type: str
  short_description: str
  summary: str
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="typescript" label="typescript" default>

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

// BBOX Annotation response formats
const ImageSchema = z.object({
  image_type: z.string(),
  short_description: z.string(),
  summary: z.string(),
});
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl json schema">

```bash
{
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
        "schema": {
            "properties": {
                "document_type": {"title": "Document_Type", "type": "string"},
                "short_description": {"title": "Short_Description", "type": "string"},
                "summary": {"title": "Summary", "type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["document_type", "short_description", "summary"],
            "title": "BBOXAnnotation",

        },
        "name": "document_annotation",
        "strict": true
    }
}
```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also provide a description for each entry, the description will be used as detailed information and instructions during the annotation; for example:

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# BBOX Annotation response formats
class Image(BaseModel):
  image_type: str = Field(..., description="The type of the image.")
  short_description: str = Field(..., description="A description in english describing the image.")
  summary: str = Field(..., description="Summarize the image.")
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="typescript" label="typescript" default>

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define the schema for the Image type
const ImageSchema = z.object({
  image_type: z.string().describe("The type of the image."),
  short_description: z.string().describe("A description in English describing the image."),
  summary: z.string().describe("Summarize the image."),
});
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl json schema">

```bash

}
```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<SectionTab as="h3" variant="secondary" sectionId="bbox-start-request">Start Request</SectionTab>

Next, make a request and ensure the response adheres to the defined structures using `bbox_annotation_format` set to the corresponding schemas:

Pixtral 12B is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving leading performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing a number of larger models. Unlike many open-source models, Pixtral is also a cutting-edge text model for its size, and does not compromise on natural language performance to excel in multimodal tasks. Pixtral uses a new vision encoder trained from scratch, which allows it to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. This gives users flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128 K tokens. Pixtral 12B substanially outperforms other open models of similar sizes (Llama-3.2 11B \\& Qwen-2-VL 7B). It also outperforms much larger open models like Llama-3.2 90B while being 7x smaller. We further contribute an open-source benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, for evaluating vision-language models in practical scenarios, and provide detailed analysis and code for standardized evaluation protocols for multimodal LLMs. Pixtral 12B is released under Apache 2.0 license.\n\nWebpage: https://mistral.ai/news/pixtral-12b/\nInference code: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference/\nEvaluation code: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-evals/\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThis paper describes Pixtral 12B, a multimodal language model trained to understand both images and text, released with open weights under an Apache 2.0 license. Pixtral is an instruction tuned model which is pretrained on large scale interleaved image and text documents, and hence is capable of multi-turn, multi-image conversation.\n\nPixtral comes with a new vision encoder which is trained with a novel RoPE-2D implementation, allowing it to process images at their native resolution and aspect ratio. In this way, the model can flexibly process images at low resolution in latency-constrained settings, while processing images at high resolution when fine-grained reasoning is required.\nWhen compared against models of a similar size in the same evaluation setting, we find that Pixtral delivers strong multimodal reasoning capabilities without sacrificing text-only reasoning performance.",

Left: Performance on MM-MT-Bench, a new multimodal, multiturn, instruction following benchmark designed to reflect real world usage of multimodal language models. Right: Performance on the public LMSys leaderboard (Vision arena, October 2024).\n\nFor instance, our model matches or exceeds the performance of models like Qwen2-VL 7B [23] and Llama-3.2 11B [6] on popular multimodal benchmarks like MMMU [24] and MathVista [14], while outperforming most open-source models on popular text-only tasks like MATH [7] and HumanEval [26]. Pixtral even outperforms much larger models like Llama-3.2 90B [6], as well as closed models such as Claude-3 Haiku [1] and Gemini-1.5 Flash 8B [18], on multimodal benchmarks.\n\nDuring evaluation of Pixtral and the baselines, we found that evaluation protocols for multimodal language models is not standardized, and that small changes in the setup can dramatically change the performance of some models. We provide thorough analysis of our experience in re-evaluating vision-language models under a common evaluation protocol.\n\nSpecifically, we identify two issues with evaluation:\n\n- Prompts: Several benchmarks have default prompts which are under-specified, and dramatically reduce the performance of leading closed source models [16, 1] compared to reported figures.\n- Evaluation Metrics: The official metrics typically require exact match, which score model generations as correct only if they exactly match the reference answer. However, this metric penalizes answers which are substantively correct but in a slightly different format (e.g., \"6.0\" vs \"6\").\n\nTo alleviate these issues, we propose 'Explicit' prompts that explicitly specify the format required by the reference answer. We further analyze the impact of flexible parsing for various models, releasing the evaluation code and prompts in an effort to establish fair and standardized evaluation protocols ${ }^{1}$.\n\nMoreover, while current multimodal benchmarks mostly evaluate short-form or multiple-choice question answering given an input image, they do not fully capture a model's utility for practical use cases (e.g. in a multi-turn, long-form assistant setting). To address this, we open-source a novel multimodal, multi-turn evaluation: MM-MT-Bench ${ }^{2}$. We find that performance on MM-MT-Bench correlates highly with ELO rankings on the LMSys Vision Leaderboard.\n\nPixtral excels at multimodal instruction following, surpassing comparable open-source models on the MM-MT-Bench benchmark (see Figure 1). Based on human preferences on the LMSys Vision Leaderboard, Pixtral 12B is currently the highest ranked Apache 2.0 model, substantially outperforming other open-models such Llama-3.2 11B [6] and Qwen2-VL 7B [23]. It even ranks higher than several closed models such as Claude-3 Opus \\& Claude-3 Sonnet [1], and several larger models such as Llama-3.2 90B [6].\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-evals/\n    ${ }^{2}$ https://huggingface.co/datasets/mistralai/MM-MT-Bench",

Pixtral uses a new vision encoder, which is trained from scratch to natively support variable image sizes and aspect ratios. Block-diagonal attention masks enable sequence packing for batching, while RoPE-2D encodings facilitate variable image sizes. Note that the attention mask and position encodings are fed to the vision transformer as additional input, and utilized only in the self-attention layers.\n\n# 2 Architectural details \n\nPixtral 12B is based on the transformer architecture [22], and consists of a multimodal decoder to perform highlevel reasoning, and a vision encoder to allow the model to ingest images. The main parameters of the model are summarized in Table 1.\n\n### 2.1 Multimodal Decoder\n\nPixtral 12B is built on top of Mistral Nemo 12B [15], a 12-billion parameter decoder-only language model that achieves strong performance across a range of knowledge and reasoning tasks.\n\n| Parameters | Decoder | Encoder |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n| dim | 5120 | 1024 |\n| n_layers | 40 | 24 |\n| head_dim | 128 | 64 |\n| hidden_dim | 14336 | 4096 |\n| n_heads | 32 | 16 |\n| n_kv_heads | 8 | 16 |\n| context_len | 131072 | 4096 |\n| vocab_size | 131072 | - |\n| patch_size | - | 16 |\n\nTable 1: Decoder and encoder parameters.\n\n### 2.2 Vision Encoder\n\nIn order for Pixtral 12B to ingest images, we train a new vision encoder from scratch, named PixtralViT. Here, our goal is to instantiate a simple architecture which is capable of processing images across a wide range of resolutions and aspect ratios. To do this, we build a 400 million parameter vision transformer [5] (see Table 1) and make four key changes over the standard architectures [17]:\nBreak tokens: In order to assist the model in distinguishing between images with the same number of patches (same area) but different aspect ratios, we include [IMAGE BREAK] tokens between image rows [2]. We further include an [IMAGE END] token at the end of an image sequence.\nGating in FFN: Instead of standard feedforward layer in the attention block, we use gating in the hidden layer [19].\nSequence packing: In order to efficiently process images within a single batch, we flatten the images along the sequence dimension and concatenate them [3]. We construct a block-diagonal mask to ensure no attention leakage between patches from different images.\nRoPE-2D: We replace traditional learned and absolute position embeddings for image patches with relative, rotary position encodings [11, 20] in the self-attention layers. While learned position embeddings must be interpolated to deal with new image sizes (often at the cost of performance), relative position encodings lend themselves naturally to variable image sizes.",

The left plot shows performance on the MM-MT-Bench, while the right plot shows performance on the LMSys-Vision ELO. Each point represents a different model, with the x-axis indicating the cost or number of parameters in billions (B) and the y-axis indicating the performance score. The shaded region in both plots highlights the best performance/cost ratio, with Pixtral 12B positioned within this region in both plots, suggesting it offers a strong balance of performance and cost efficiency. Other models like Qwen-2-VL 72B and Qwen-2-VL 7B also show high performance but at varying costs."
