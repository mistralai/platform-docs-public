# Quickstart

Below is a quick guide to get you started with Vibe, for more details see [Configuration](configuration) to learn how to configure Vibe to your needs.

<SectionTab as="h1" sectionId="get-started">Get Started</SectionTab>

:::note
Before continuing, make sure you have [installed Vibe](install).
:::

First, navigate to your project's root directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Once there, you can run Vibe:

```bash
vibe
```

/>

This will start the interactive CLI interface.

If this is your first time running Vibe, it will:
- Create a default configuration file at `~/.vibe/config.toml`
- Prompt you to pick a theme.

/>

- Prompt you to enter your API key if it's not already configured, you can create one [here](https://console.mistral.ai/codestral/vibe).

  width="600px"

/>

- Save your API key to `~/.vibe/.env` for future use

Once done, you can start interacting with the agent! Currently Vibe by default uses our **Devstral 2** model, you can also use Devstral Small 2 or even your own [custom model](configuration#change-providers).

<SectionTab as="h1" sectionId="get-started">Usage</SectionTab>

We recommend using Vibe in interactive mode, but you can also use it in programmatic mode, learn more about both below.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="interactive-mode">Interactive Mode</SectionTab>

Simply run `vibe` to enter the interactive chat loop, this mode simulates a chat interface with the agent.

- **Multi-line Input**: Press `Ctrl+J` or `Shift+Enter` for select terminals to insert a newline.
- **File Paths**: Reference files in your prompt using the `@` symbol for smart autocompletion (e.g., `> Read the file @src/agent.py`).
- **Shell Commands**: Prefix any command with `!` to execute it directly in your shell, bypassing the agent (e.g., `> !ls -l`).

You can also directly start Vibe with a prompt with the following command:

```bash
vibe "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

Vibe also allows you to use slash commands and keyboard shortcuts for meta-actions and configuration changes during a session such as:
- `/h`, `/help`: Show help message
- `/stats`, `/status`: Display agent statistics
- `/cfg`, `/config`, `/model`, `/theme`: Edit config settings
- `/r`, `/reload`: Reload configuration from disk
- `/clear`, `/reset`: Clear conversation history
- `/log`, `/logpath`: Show path to current interaction log file
- `/compact`, `/summarize`: Compact conversation history by summarizing
- `/exit`, `/q`, `/quit`: Exit the application
- `!<command>` Execute bash command directly
- `@path/to/file/` Autocompletes file paths
- `Enter` Submit message
- `Ctrl+J` / `Shift+Enter` Insert newline
- `Escape` Interrupt agent or close dialogs
- `Ctrl+C` Quit (or clear input if text present)
- `Ctrl+O` Toggle tool output view
- `Ctrl+T` Toggle todo view
- `Shift+Tab` Toggle auto-approve mode

:::note
The `--auto-approve` flag automatically approves all tool executions without prompting. In interactive mode, you can also toggle auto-approve on/off using `Shift+Tab`.
:::

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="programmatic-mode">Programmatic Mode</SectionTab>

You can run Vibe non-interactively by piping input or using the `--prompt` flag. This is useful for scripting, it allows you to run Vibe in a more streamline manner. This will not enter the interactive chat loop interface.

```bash
vibe --prompt "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

By default it will use `auto-approve` mode.

Vibe is built to keep you in control. For substantial tasks (refactors, multi-file updates, cleanups), Vibe splits the work into steps it can execute safely and asks for confirmation before proceeding.  
You can also cap the number of steps or set a maximum session cost, and control general permissions and usage in the config file, learn more about Configuration [here](configuration).

Before editing files or running commands, Vibe shows a full preview and asks for confirmation.

After each step, you see exactly what was executed and the resulting output.

You’re ready to use Mistral Vibe in your terminal. Start with small tasks, try the interactive commands, and build up from there.
