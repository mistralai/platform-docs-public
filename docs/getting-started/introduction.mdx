## Explore the Mistral AI APIs

The [Mistral AI APIs](https://console.mistral.ai/) empower LLM applications via:

- [Text generation](/capabilities/completion), enables streaming and provides the ability to display partial model results in real-time
- [Vision](/capabilities/vision), enables the analysis of images and provides insights based on visual content in addition to text.
- [Code generation](/capabilities/code_generation), enpowers code generation tasks, including fill-in-the-middle and code completion
- [Embeddings](/capabilities/embeddings), useful for RAG where it represents the meaning of text as a list of numbers
- [Function calling](/capabilities/function_calling), enables Mistral models to connect to external tools
- [Fine-tuning](/capabilities/finetuning), enables developers to create customized and specilized models
- [JSON mode](/capabilities/json_mode), enables developers to set the response format to json_object
- [Guardrailing](/capabilities/guardrailing), enables developers to enforce policies at the system level of Mistral models
