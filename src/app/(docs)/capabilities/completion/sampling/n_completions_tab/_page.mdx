**N** represents the number of completions to return for each request. This parameter is useful when you want to generate multiple responses for a single input. Each completion will be a unique response generated by the model, providing a variety of outputs to choose from.

:::note
Currently `mistral-large-2512` does not support N completions.
:::

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="key-points">Key Points</SectionTab>

- **Multiple Responses**: By setting `N` to a value greater than 1, you can get multiple responses for the same input.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Input tokens are only billed once, regardless of the number of completions requested. This makes it cost-effective to explore different possibilities.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="n-example">Example</SectionTab>

Here's an example of how to use the `N` parameter in the API:

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="python" label="python" default>

```py
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
model = "ministral-3b-latest"

client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the best mythical creature? Answer with a single word.",
        },
    ],
    temperature = 1, # Increasing randomness and diversity of the output, this is required to be higher than 0 to have diverse outputs
    n = 10 # Number of completions
)

for i, choice in enumerate(chat_response.choices):
    print(choice.message.content)
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="output" label="output">

```text
Phoenix.
Dragon
Dragon
Unicorn
Unicorn
Phoenix
Unicorn
Dragon
Dragon.
Unicorn
```

    </TabItem> 
</Tabs>

In this example, the model generates 10 responses for the same input prompt. This allows you to see a variety of possible answers and choose the one that best fits your needs.
