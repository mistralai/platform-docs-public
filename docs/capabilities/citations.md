Citations enable models to ground their responses and provide references, making them a powerful feature for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic applications. This feature allows the model to provide the source of the information extracted from a document or chunk of data from a tool call.

Our models have been deeply trained to ground on documents and provide sources, with a built-in feature to extract references and citations.

## Code Example

To provide documents to the model, you can include the sources as a function call response.  
Below is an example of references, in this case from Wikipedia, using tool calls.

        "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth’s climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years."

Such machines may be called AIs."

### Initialize Client

```python
import os
from mistralai import Mistral, ToolMessage
import json

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
model = "mistral-large-latest"

client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)
```

### Define the Tool
In this case, we will create a `get_information` tool that will return the references mentioned previously.

```python
get_information_tool = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_information",
        "description": "Get information from external source.",
        "parameters": {}
    },
}

def get_information():
    return json.dumps(references)
```

### Set Up Chat History

```python
chat_history = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Answer the user by providing references to the source of the information."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Who won the Nobel Prize in 2024?"
    }
]
```

### Make the Initial Chat Request

```python
chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model=model,
    messages=chat_history,
    tools=[get_information_tool],
)

if hasattr(chat_response.choices[0].message, 'tool_calls'):
    tool_call = chat_response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
    chat_history.append(chat_response.choices[0].message)
    print(tool_call)
else:
    print("No tool call found in the response")
```

Output:
```
function=FunctionCall(name='get_information', arguments='{}') id='F4HiRgdZp' type=None index=0
```

### Handle Tool Call and Append Result

```python
result = get_information()

tool_call_result = ToolMessage(
    content=result,
    tool_call_id=tool_call.id,
    name=tool_call.function.name,
)

# Append the tool call message to the chat_history
chat_history.append(tool_call_result)
```

### Make the Final Chat Request

```python
chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model=model,
    messages=chat_history,
    tools=[get_information_tool],
)

print(chat_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Output:
```
[TextChunk(text='The Nobel Peace Prize for 2024 was awarded to the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations (Nihon Hidankyo) for their activism against nuclear weapons, including efforts by survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki', type='text'), ReferenceChunk(reference_ids=[0], type='reference'), TextChunk(text='.', type='text')]
```

### Extract and Print References

```python
from mistralai.models import TextChunk, ReferenceChunk

refs_used = []

# Print the main response and save each reference
for chunk in chat_response.choices[0].message.content:
    if isinstance(chunk, TextChunk):
        print(chunk.text, end="")
    elif isinstance(chunk, ReferenceChunk):
        refs_used += chunk.reference_ids

# Print references only
if refs_used:
    print("\n\nSources:")
    for i, ref in enumerate(set(refs_used), 1):
        reference = json.loads(result)[str(ref)]
        print(f"\n{i}. {reference['title']}: {reference['url']}")
```

Output:
```
The Nobel Peace Prize for 2024 was awarded to the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations (Nihon Hidankyo) for their activism against nuclear weapons, including efforts by survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
