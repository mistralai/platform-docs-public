Mistral AI is a research lab building the best open source models in the world. La Plateforme enables developers and enterprises to build new products and applications, powered by Mistralâ€™s open source and commercial LLMs. 

## Mistral AI Large Language Models (LLMs)

We release both open source and commercial models, driving innovation and convenience for our developer community. Our models are state-of-the-art for their multilingual, code generation, maths, and advanced reasoning capabilities.

### Open Source

- Mistral 7b, our first dense model released [September 2023](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/)
- Mixtral 8x7b, our first sparse mixture-of-experts released [December 2023](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/)
- Mixtral 8x22b, our best open source model to date released [April 2024](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-8x22b/)

### Commercial

- Mistral Small, our cost-efficient reasoning model for low-latency workloads
- Mistral Medium, useful for intermediate tasks that require moderate reasoning; please note that this model will be deprecated in the coming months
- Mistral Large, our top-tier reasoning model for high-complexity tasks
- Mistral Embeddings, our state-of-the-art semantic for extracting representation of text extracts
- Codestral, our cutting-edge language model for coding 

For our commercial models, we are always improving and iteratively deploying them. Keep up to date on our model versioning here.

## Explore the Mistral AI APIs

The [Mistral AI APIs](https://console.mistral.ai/) empower LLM applications via:

- [Text generation](/capabilities/completion), enables streaming and provides the ability to display partial model results in real-time
- [Code generation](/capabilities/code_generation), enpowers code generation tasks, including fill-in-the-middle and code completion
- [Embeddings](/capabilities/embeddings), useful for RAG where it represents the meaning of text as a list of numbers
- [Function calling](/capabilities/function_calling), enables Mistral models to connect to external tools
- [JSON mode](/capabilities/json_mode), enables developers to set the response format to json_object
- [Guardrailing](/capabilities/guardrailing), enables developers to enforce policies at the system level of Mistral models
