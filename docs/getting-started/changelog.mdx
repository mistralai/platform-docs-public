This is the list of changes to the Mistral API.

September 17, 2024
- We released Pixtral (`pixtral-12b-2409`) and Mistral Small v24.09 (`mistral-small-2409`).
- We reduced price on our flagship model, Mistral Large 2.

September 13, 2024
- In le Chat, we added a mitigation against an obfuscated prompt method that could lead to data exfiltration, reported by researchers [Xiaohan Fu](https://xhfu.me/) and Earlence Fernandes. The attack required users to willingfully copy and paste adversarial prompts and provide personal data to the model. No user was impacted and no data was exfiltrated.

July 29, 2024

- We released Mistral Large 2 (`mistral-large-2407`).
- We added fine-tuning support for Codestral, Mistral Nemo and Mistral Large. Now the model choices for fine-tuning are `open-mistral-7b` (v0.3), `mistral-small-latest` (`mistral-small-2402`), `codestral-latest` (`codestral-2405`), `open-mistral-nemo` and , `mistral-large-latest` (`mistral-large-2407`)

- API endpoints: We renamed 3 API endpoints and added 2 model endpoints.

    - `mistral-small-latest` (aka `mistral-small-2402`): new model.

    - `mistral-large-latest` (aka `mistral-large-2402`): our new flagship model with leading performance. 

- New API capabilities:
    - [Function calling](/capabilities/function_calling): available for Mistral Small and Mistral Large. 
    - [JSON mode](/capabilities/json_mode): available for Mistral Small and Mistral Large

- [La Plateforme](https://console.mistral.ai/):
    - We added multiple currency support to the payment system, including the option to pay in US dollars. 
    - We introduced enterprise platform features including admin management, which allows users to manage individuals from your organization.

- [Le Chat](https://chat.mistral.ai/): 
    - We introduced the brand new chat interface Le Chat to easily interact with Mistral models. 
    - You can currently interact with three models: Mistral Large, Mistral Next, and Mistral Small. 

Jan. 11, 2024
- We have enhanced the API's strictness. Previously the API would silently ignores unsupported parameters in the requests, but it now strictly enforces the validity of all parameters. If you have unsupported parameters in your request, you will see the error message "Extra inputs are not permitted".
- A previous version of the [guardrailing documentation](/capabilities/guardrailing) incorrectly referred to the API parameter as `safe_mode` instead of `safe_prompt`. We corrected this in the documentation. 

Jan. 16, 2024
- We added token usage information in streaming requests. You can find it in the last chunk returned.
