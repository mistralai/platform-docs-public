# Coding

LLMs are powerfull tools for text generation, and they also show great performance in code generation for multiple tasks, both for code completion, code generation and agentic tool use for semi-automated software development.

We provide 2 major families of llms for coding:
- **Codestral**: Specifically trained for Code Generation and FIM.
- **Devstral**: Specifically trained for Agentic Tool Use for Software Development.

Note that we also provide **Codestral Embed**, for semantic search and embedding code databases, repositories, and powering coding assistants with state-of-the-art retrieval. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/embeddings/code_embeddings).

### Endpoints & Models

We provide 2 main endpoints:
- Fill-In-The-Middle : `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/fim/completions`
  - for code completion and code generation; supporting `codestral-latest`.
- Instruction Following: `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions`
  - for coding and agentic tool use; supporting `codestral-latest`, `devstral-small-latest` and `devstral-medium-latest`.

### Integrations using our Models

If you are interested on leveraging our models in your favorite IDE, you can find below a list of integrations.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="mistral-vibe">Mistral Vibe</SectionTab>

Mistral Vibe is a command-line coding assistant powered by Mistral's models. It provides a conversational interface to your codebase, allowing you to use natural language to explore, modify, and interact with your projects through a powerful set of tools.

You can find more information about it [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/mistral_vibe/introduction) or access the github repository [here](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe).
