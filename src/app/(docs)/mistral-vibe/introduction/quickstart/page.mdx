# Quickstart

Below is a quick guide to get you started with Vibe, for more details see [Configuration](configuration) to learn how to configure Vibe to your needs.

<SectionTab as="h1" sectionId="get-started">Get Started</SectionTab>

:::note
Before continuing, make sure you have [installed Vibe](install).
:::

First, navigate to your project's root directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Once there, you can run Vibe:

```bash
vibe
```

<Image

  alt="vibe_running_in_a_terminal"
  width="600px"
  centered
/>

This will start the interactive CLI interface.

If this is your first time running Vibe, it will:
- Create a default configuration file at `~/.vibe/config.toml`
- Prompt you to pick a theme.

<Image

  alt="select_your_preferred_theme"
  width="600px"
  centered
/>

- Prompt you to enter your API key if it's not already configured, you can create one [here](https://console.mistral.ai/codestral/cli).

<Image
  url='/img/vibekey.png'
  alt="entering_the_API_key_on_first_launch"
  width="600px"
  centered
/>

- Save your API key to `~/.vibe/.env` for future use

Alternatively, you can configure your API key separately using `vibe --setup`.

Once done, you can start interacting with the agent! Currently Vibe by default uses our **Devstral 2** model, you can also use Devstral Small 2 or even your own [custom model](configuration#change-providers).

<SectionTab as="h1" sectionId="get-started">Usage</SectionTab>

### Learn how to use Vibe

We recommend using Vibe in interactive mode, but you can also use it in programmatic mode, learn more about both below.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="interactive-mode">Interactive Mode</SectionTab>

Simply run `vibe` to enter the interactive chat loop, this mode simulates a chat interface with the agent.

- **Multi-line Input**: Press `Ctrl+J` or `Shift+Enter` for select terminals to insert a newline.
- **File Paths**: Reference files in your prompt using the `@` symbol for smart autocompletion (e.g., `> Read the file @src/agent.py`).
- **Shell Commands**: Prefix any command with `!` to execute it directly in your shell, bypassing the agent (e.g., `> !ls -l`).
- **External Editor**: Press `Ctrl+G` to edit your current input in an external editor.
- **Tool Output Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+O` to toggle the tool output view.
- **Todo View Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+T` to toggle the todo list view.
- **Auto-Approve Toggle**: Press `Shift+Tab` to toggle auto-approve mode on/off.

You can also directly start Vibe with a prompt with the following command:

```bash
vibe "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

Vibe also allows you to use slash commands and keyboard shortcuts for meta-actions and configuration changes during a session such as:
- `/h`, `/help`: Show a help message
- `/config`, `/theme`, `/model`: Edit configuration settings interactively
- `/clear`: Clear conversation history
- ...
- `Ctrl+T` Toggle todo view
- `Shift+Tab` Toggle auto-approve mode
- ...
And more, use `/help` to display all available commands.

<SectionTab as="h3" variant="secondary" sectionId="custom-slash-commands">Custom Slash Commands</SectionTab>

You can define your own slash commands through the skills system. Skills are reusable components that extend Vibe's functionality.

To create a custom slash command:
- Create a skill directory with a `SKILL.md` file
- Set `user-invocable = true` in the skill metadata
- Define the command logic in your skill

Example skill metadata:
```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: My custom skill with slash commands
user-invocable: true
---
```

Learn more about [Agents](../agents_and_skills#skills).

Custom slash commands appear in the autocompletion menu alongside built-in commands.

<SectionTab as="h3" variant="secondary" sectionId="agents-switching">Agent Switching</SectionTab>

You can define Agents and change them with `Shift+Tab`, below you can find a non-exaustive list of agents Vibe is packaged with:
- `default`: The standard default Vibe behavior, built for general usage requesting approval for tool execution.
- `plan`: Read-only agent for exploration and planning.
- `auto approve`: Automatically approves all tool executions without prompting.
- ...

:::tip
**Trust Folder System**
Vibe includes a trust folder system to ensure you only run the agent in directories you trust.
:::

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="programmatic-mode">Programmatic Mode</SectionTab>

You can run Vibe non-interactively by piping input or using the `--prompt` flag. This is useful for scripting, it allows you to run Vibe in a more streamline manner. This will not enter the interactive chat loop interface.

```bash
vibe --prompt "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

By default, it uses `auto-approve` mode.

When using `--prompt`, you can specify additional options:

- **`--max-turns N`**: Limit the maximum number of assistant turns. The session will stop after N turns.
- **`--max-price DOLLARS`**: Set a maximum cost limit in dollars. The session will be interrupted if the cost exceeds this limit.
- **`--enabled-tools TOOL`**: Enable specific tools. In programmatic mode, this disables all other tools. Can be specified multiple times. Supports exact names, glob patterns (e.g., `bash*`), or regex with `re:` prefix (e.g., `re:^serena_.*$`).
- **`--output FORMAT`**: Set the output format. Options:
  - `text` (default): Human-readable text output
  - `json`: All messages as JSON at the end
  - `streaming`: Newline-delimited JSON per message

Example:

```bash
vibe --prompt "Analyze the codebase" --max-turns 5 --max-price 1.0 --output json
```

Vibe is built to keep you in control. For substantial tasks (refactors, multi-file updates, cleanups), Vibe splits the work into steps it can execute safely and asks for confirmation before proceeding.  
You can also cap the number of steps or set a maximum session cost, and control general permissions and usage in the config file, learn more about Configuration [here](configuration).

Before editing files or running commands, Vibe shows a full preview and asks for confirmation.

After each step, you see exactly what was executed and the resulting output.

You’re ready to use Mistral Vibe in your terminal. Start with small tasks, try the interactive commands, and build up from there.
