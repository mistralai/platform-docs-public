## Citations & References

Citations enable models to ground their responses and provide references, making them a powerful feature for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic applications. This feature allows the model to provide the source of the information extracted from a document or chunk of data from a tool call.

Our models have been deeply trained to ground on documents and provide sources, with a built-in feature to extract references and citations.

Before continuing, we recommend reading the [Chat Competions](completion) documentation to learn more about the chat completions API and how to use it before proceeding.

<SectionTab as="h1" sectionId="usage">Usage</SectionTab>

To provide documents to the model, you can include the sources as a function call response.  
Below is an example of references, in this case from Wikipedia, using tool calls.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="setup">Setup Tool</SectionTab>

To use citations and references, you need to set up a tool call that will return the references.

In this case, we will create a `get_information` tool that will return the references mentioned previously.
