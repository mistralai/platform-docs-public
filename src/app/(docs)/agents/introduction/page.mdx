# What are AI agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems powered by large language models (LLMs) that, given high-level instructions, can plan, use tools, carry out processing steps, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents leverage advanced natural language processing capabilities to understand and execute complex tasks efficiently and can even collaborate with each other to achieve more sophisticated outcomes.

Our Agents and Conversations API allows developers to build such agents, leveraging multiple features such as:
- Multiple mutlimodal models available, **text and vision models**.
- **Persistent state** across conversations.
- Ability to have conversations with **base models**, **a single agent**, and **multiple agents**.
- Built-in connector tools for **code execution**, **web search**, **image generation** and **document library** out of the box.
- **Handoff capability** to use different agents as part of a workflow, allowing agents to call other agents.
- Features supported via our chat completions endpoint are also supported, such as:
  - **Structured Outputs**
  - **Document Understanding**
  - **Tool Usage**
  - **Citations**
