# Rate Limits & Usage tiers

When using the Mistral API, you may encounter rate limits. These limits are designed to ensure fair usage, balance load and prevent abuse of the API.

:::note[ ]
Please visit https://admin.mistral.ai/plateforme/limits for detailed information on the current rate limit and usage tiers for your workspace.

To prevent misuse and manage the capacity of our API, we have implemented limits on how much a workspace can utilize the Mistral API.

We offer two types of rate limits:

- Requests per second (RPS)
- Tokens per minute/month

Key points to note:

- Rate limits are set at the workspace level.
- Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of rate limits.
- In case you need to raise your usage limits, please feel free to contact us by utilizing the support button, providing details about your specific use case.

You can view the rate and usage limits for your workspace under the [limits](https://admin.mistral.ai/plateforme/limits) section on la Plateforme.

We offer various tiers on the platform, including a **free API tier** with restrictive rate limits. The free API tier is designed to allow you to try and explore our API. For actual projects and production use, we recommend upgrading to a higher tier.
