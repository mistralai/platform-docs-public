Audio input capabilities enable models to chat and understand audio directly, this can be used for both chat use cases via audio or for optimal transcription purposes.

### Models with Audio Capabilities
Audio capable models:
- **Voxtral Small** (`voxtral-small-latest`) with audio input for [chat](#chat-with-audio) use cases.
- **Voxtral Mini** (`voxtral-mini-latest`) with audio input for [chat](#chat-with-audio) use cases
- And **Voxtral Mini Transcribe** (`voxtral-mini-latest` via `audio/transcriptions`), with an efficient [transcription](#transcription) only service.

## Chat with Audio

Our Voxtral models are capable of being used for chat use cases with our chat completions endpoint.

### Passing an Audio File

To pass a local audio file, you can encode it in base64 and pass it as a string.

<Tabs groupId="code">
  <TabItem value="python" label="python">

```python
import base64
from mistralai import Mistral

# Retrieve the API key from environment variables
api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]

# Specify model
model = "voxtral-mini-latest"

# Initialize the Mistral client
client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

# Encode the audio file in base64
with open("examples/files/bcn_weather.mp3", "rb") as f:
    content = f.read()
audio_base64 = base64.b64encode(content).decode('utf-8')

# Get the chat response
chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model=model,
    messages=[{

        **Assistant**

        Sure, here is the transcription of what you said:  
        "Today on July 15th, 2025, Mistral AI is announcing the new Voxtral models."  
        And here is the Python code to generate the first n digits of the Fibonacci sequence:  
        ```python
            def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 0:
            return []
        elif n == 1:
            return [0]
        elif n == 2:
            return [0, 1]

        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            next_value = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
            fib_sequence.append(next_value)

        return fib_sequence

        # Example usage:
        n = 10  # Change this value to get the first n digits of the Fibonacci sequence
        print(fibonacci(n))
        ```
        This code defines a function `fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list containing the first `n` digits of the Fibonacci sequence. You can change the value of `n` to get the desired number of Fibonacci digits.

        **Assistant**

        The speaker who delivers the farewell address is more engaging and inspiring.  
        They express gratitude and optimism, emphasizing the importance of self-government and citizenship.  
        They also share personal experiences and observations, making the speech more relatable and heartfelt.  
        In contrast, the second speaker provides factual information about the weather in Barcelona, which is less engaging and lacks the emotional depth of the first speaker's address.

## Transcription

Transcription provides an optimized endpoint for transcription purposes and currently supports `voxtral-mini-latest`, which runs **Voxtral Mini Transcribe**.

**Parameters**  
We provide different settings and parameters for transcription, such as:
- `timestamp_granularities`: This allows you to set timestamps to track not only "what" was said but also "when". You can find more about timestamps [here](#transcription-with-timestamps).
- `language`: Our transcription service also works as a language detection service. However, you can manually set the language of the transcription for better accuracy if the language of the audio is already known.

### Passing an Audio File

Among the different methods to pass the audio, you can directly provide a path to a file to upload and transcribe it as follows:

<Tabs groupId="code">

# Get the transcription

const transcriptionResponse = await client.audio.transcriptions.complete({
  model: "voxtral-mini-latest",
  file: {
    fileName: "audio.mp3",

Whether we've seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people, in living rooms, in schools, at farms and on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts, All these conversations are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going. Every day, I learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man. Over the course of these eight years, I've seen the goodness, the resilience, and the hope of the American people. I've seen neighbors looking out for each other as we rescued our economy from the worst crisis of our lifetimes. I've hugged cancer survivors who finally know the security of affordable health care. I've seen communities like Joplin rebuild from disaster, and cities like Boston show the world that no terrorist will ever break the American spirit. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. I've mourned with grieving families searching for answers. And I found grace in a Charleston church. I've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch, and our wounded warriors walk again. I've seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks.

        **Transcription**  
        This week, I traveled to Chicago to deliver my final farewell address to the nation, following in the tradition of presidents before me. It was an opportunity to say thank you. Whether we've seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people, in living rooms, in schools, at farms and on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts, All these conversations are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going. Every day, I learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man. Over the course of these eight years, I've seen the goodness, the resilience, and the hope of the American people. I've seen neighbors looking out for each other as we rescued our economy from the worst crisis of our lifetimes. I've hugged cancer survivors who finally know the security of affordable health care. I've seen communities like Joplin rebuild from disaster, and cities like Boston show the world that no terrorist will ever break the American spirit. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. I've mourned with grieving families searching for answers. And I found grace in a Charleston church. I've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch, and our wounded warriors walk again. I've seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. I've learned from students who are building robots and curing diseases, and who will change the world in ways we can't even imagine.

## Transcription with Timestamps

You can request timestamps for the transcription by passing the `timestamp_granularities` parameter, currently supporting `segment`.  
It will return the start and end time of each segment in the audio file.

## FAQ

- **What's the maximum audio length?**

    The maximum length will depend on the endpoint used, currently the limits are as follows:
    - ≈20 minutes for [Chat with Audio](#chat-with-audio) for both models.
    - ≈15 minutes for [Transcription](#transcription), longer transcriptions will be available soon.

:::tip
Here are some tips if you need to handle longer audio files:
- **Divide the audio into smaller segments:** Transcribe each segment individually. However, be aware that this might lead to a loss of context, difficulties in splitting the audio at natural pauses (such as mid-sentence), and the need to combine the transcriptions afterward.
- **Increase the playback speed:** Send the file at a faster pace by speeding up the audio. Keep in mind that this can reduce audio quality and require adjusting the transcription timestamps to align with the original audio file.
