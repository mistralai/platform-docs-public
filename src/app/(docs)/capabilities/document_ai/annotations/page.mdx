# Annotations

In addition to the basic OCR functionality, Mistral Document AI API adds the `annotations` functionality, which allows you to extract information in a structured json-format that you provide.

### What can you do with Annotations?

Specifically, it offers two types of annotations: 
- `bbox_annotation`: gives you the annotation of the bboxes extracted by the OCR model (charts/ figures etc) based on user requirement and provided bbox/image annotation format. The user may ask to describe/caption the figure for instance.
- `document_annotation`: returns the annotation of the entire document based on the provided document annotation format.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="key-capabilities">Key Capabilities</SectionTab>

* Labeling and annotating data
* Extraction and structuring of specific information from documents into a predefined JSON format
* Automation of data extraction to reduce manual entry and errors
* Efficient handling of large document volumes for enterprise-level applications

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="common-use-cases">Common Use Cases</SectionTab>

* Parsing of forms, classification of documents, and processing of images, including text, charts, and signatures
* Conversion of charts to tables, extraction of fine print from figures, or definition of custom image types
* Capture of receipt data, including merchant names and transaction amounts, for expense management.
* Extraction of key information like vendor details and amounts from invoices for automated accounting.
* Extraction of key clauses and terms from contracts for easier review and management

- All document types: 
  - After regular OCR is finished; we call a Vision capable LLM for all bboxes individually with the provided annotation format.

<SectionTab as="h2" variant="secondary" sectionId="document-annotation-explanation">Document Annotation</SectionTab>

- All document types: 
  - We run OCR and send the output text in Markdown, along with the first eight extracted image bounding boxes, to a vision-capable LMM, together with the provided annotation format.

You can use our API with the following document formats:
- [OCR with pdf](basic_ocr#ocr-with-pdf)
- [OCR with image](basic_ocr#ocr-with-image): even from low-quality or handwritten sources.
- scans, DOCX, PPTX...

In the code snippets below, we will consider the `OCR with pdf` format.

### How to Annotate

As previously mentionned, you can either:
- Use the `bbox_annotation` functionality, allowing you to extract information from the bboxes of the document.
- Use the `document_annotation` functionality, allowing you to extract information from the entire document.
  - Optionally, we also provide the ability to add a `document_annotation_prompt`, a high level general prompt to guide and instruct on how to annotate the document.
- Use both functionalities at the same time.

<Faq>
<FaqItem question="Are there any limits regarding the Document AI API?">
Yes, there are certain limitations for the Document Intelligence API. Uploaded document files must not exceed 50 MB in size and should be no longer than 1,000 pages.
</FaqItem>
<FaqItem question="Are there any limits regarding the Annotations?">
When using Document Annotations, each annotation accepts a maximum of 8 image bounding boxes. We recommend using document annotation for text-focused documents.
