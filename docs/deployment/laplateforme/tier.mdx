## How does rate limits rate work? 

To prevent misuse and manage the capacity of our API, we have implemented limits on how much a workspace can utilize the Mistral API.

We offer two types of rate limits:

- Requests per second (RPS)
- Tokens per minute/month

Key points to note:

- Rate limits are set at the workspace level.
- Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of rate limits.
- In case you need to raise your usage limits, please feel free to contact us by utilizing the support button, providing details about your specific use case.

## Usage tiers 

You can view the rate and usage limits for your workspace under the [limits](https://console.mistral.ai/limits/) section on la Plateforme.

We offer various tiers on the platform, including a **free API tier** with restrictive rate limits. The free API tier is designed to allow you to try and explore our API. For actual projects and production use, we recommend upgrading to a higher tier.
